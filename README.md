SDCAlertView
============
`SDCAlertView` is intended as a pixel-for-pixel `UIAlertView` duplicate in iOS 7, with added functionality that a particular company at a particular developer's conference promised, but never delivered. Most importantly, `SDCAlertView` **adds support for custom content using the** `contentView` **property**.

`SDCAlertView` doesn't just look like a system alert in terms of user interface elements, it is the result of completely reverse-engineering `UIAlertView`. The view hierarchy, labels, table views, animations, everything has been looked at and incorporated as much as possible.

How do I use it?
================
The class is a drop-in replacement for `UIAlertView`. All public APIs for `UIAlertView` have been duplicated and implemented, so all you need to do is import `SDCAlertView.h` and change any `UIAlertView` to `SDCAlertView`.

And you're sure it's the same?
==============================
For 90% (which is an estimate and not actually measured), yes. Unfortunately, sometimes there was just no telling how certain methods were implemented, or private APIs whose implementations can only be guessed.

What has been successfully duplicated:
--------------------------------------

- Entire `UIAlertView` public API, including `UIAlertViewDelegate`
- The dimensions and positioning of all views in all alert configurations
- Font sizes for labels, text fields, and buttons
- User interaction with alert, including parallax effect
- Showing and dismissing animations
- Faded background and disabling of underlying UI elements

What won't be duplicated:
-------------------------

- Special interaction with the system. The system does not consider instances of `SDCAlertView` actual alerts, which means that, for example, the `alertViewCancel:` method from `SDCAlertViewDelegate` will never be called.

- Text field placeholders in different languages. Login and Password are entered as localized strings, but they aren't actually translated.

What is not implemented yet:
----------------------------

- Creating a "queue" of alerts and making sure they interact properly
- Setting the cancel button index
- The `visible` property does not behave exactly the same as `UIAlertView`'s `visible` property
- The `animated` argument in `-dismissWithClickedButtonIndex:animated:` is ignored; alert views will always dismiss with animation
- Cocoapods support
- Block-based syntax
- More customization of alert
- Using autoresizing masks for content view

Usage
=====
The usage is exactly the same as it is for `UIAlertView`. Any documentation that applies to some `UIAlertView` API, also applies to the same `SDCAlertView` API.

To use the `contentView` property, you have to apply auto-layout constraints to it and its subviews. The `contentView` property will be the same width as the alert, but the height is dependent on its content, so you have to set that too. See [SDCViewController](SDCViewController.m) for a few examples of how to use `contentView`. See [`SDCAutoLayout`](https://github.com/Scott90/SDCAutoLayout) for an `NSLayoutConstraint` category that makes creating constraints a little easier.

Installation
============
The easiest way to install is, of course, by using Cocoapods. The name of the pod is `SDCAlertView`.

If you're not using Cocoapods, you need at least:

- SDCAlertView.{h,m}
- SDCAlertViewViewController.{h,m}
- SDCAlertViewContentView.{h,m}
- SDCAlertViewBackgroundView.{h,m}
- SDCAlertViewBackground.png (for older generation iPads)
- SDCAlertViewBackground&#064;2x.png

The project also depends on [RBBAnimation](https://github.com/robb/RBBAnimation) and [SDCAutoLayout](https://github.com/Scott90/SDCAutoLayout). These dependencies are handled for you if you use Cocoapods.

- Lee McDermott ([@lmcd](https://github.com/lmcd)) for reverse-engineering the showing and dismissing animations.

Thanks both!
